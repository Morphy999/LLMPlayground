# LLMPlayground

This repository contains code and experiments for building large language models (LLMs) from scratch, following the guidance of the book LLM From Scratch. It focuses on developing and testing custom implementations to gain a deep understanding of how these models work internally.

Additionally, the project aims to explore fine-tuning techniques using specific datasets to adapt the models for specialized tasks, which will be defined throughout the development process.

The main goal is to provide a practical learning space, document the steps and results, and serve as a progressive guide for those interested in understanding and building LLMs hands-on.
