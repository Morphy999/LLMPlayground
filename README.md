# LLMPlayground

This repository contains code and experiments for building large language models (LLMs) from scratch, following the guidance of the book *Build A Large Language Model (From Scratch)*. It focuses on developing and testing custom implementations to gain a deep understanding of how these models work internally.

Additionally, the project aims to explore fine-tuning techniques using specific datasets to adapt the models for specialized tasks, which will be defined throughout the development process.

The main goal is to provide a practical learning space, document the steps and results, and serve as a progressive guide for those interested in understanding and building LLMs hands-on.
